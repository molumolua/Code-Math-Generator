        "problem": "Chandra has four bowls.  Each one is a different color (red, blue, yellow, green).  She also has exactly one glass the same color as each bowl.  If she chooses a bowl and a glass from the cupboard, how many pairings are possible?  One such pairing is a blue bowl and a yellow glass.",
        "solution": "Chandra has four bowls, each a different color: red, blue, yellow, and green. She also has four glasses, each matching the color of a bowl. The task is to determine the number of possible pairings when choosing one bowl and one glass.\n\n1. Chandra has 4 bowls and 4 glasses.\n2. Each bowl can be paired with any of the 4 glasses.\n3. The number of pairings is calculated by multiplying the number of bowls by the number of glasses.\n4. Therefore, the total number of pairings is \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\).\n\nThus, the number of possible pairings is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

        "solution": "The distance between two cities on a map is 15 inches, and the scale is 0.25 inches = 3 miles. To find the actual distance between the cities, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many miles 1 inch on the map represents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Miles per inch} = \\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{0.25 \\text{ inches}} = 12 \\text{ miles per inch}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the actual distance for 15 inches on the map:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Actual distance} = 15 \\text{ inches} \\times 12 \\text{ miles per inch} = 180 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the actual distance between the two cities is \\boxed{180} miles.",
